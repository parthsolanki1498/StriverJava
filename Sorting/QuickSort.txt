Quick sort sorts any given data structure into Ascending order but can also be used
to sort in the descending order with minor tweaks.

Quick Sort has Time Complexity of O(n logn) and Space Complexity of O(1).
It is same as Merge Sort's but doesn't use the extra temporary array to sort

Example Array = [ 4, 6, 2, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3]

Now to solve using Quick Sort, we'll first pick the pivot element
(How to pick pivot element, apply these four steps, it could be any from given ones)

1. First element in the array
2. Last element in the array
3. Median element in the array
4. Random element in the array

Picking the Pivot is just the first part, we need to place it in its correct position
