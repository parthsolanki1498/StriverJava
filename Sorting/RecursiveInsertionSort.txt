The approach will be the following:

1. First, call the recursive function with the given array, the size of the array, and the index of the selected element(letâ€™s say i).

2. Inside that recursive function, take the element at index i from the unsorted array.

3. Then, place the element in its corresponding position in the sorted part(using swapping).

4. After that, Shift the remaining elements accordingly.

5. Finally, call the recursion increasing the index(i) by 1.

6. The recursion will continue until the index reaches n(i.e. All the elements are covered).
Base Case: if(i == n) return;
