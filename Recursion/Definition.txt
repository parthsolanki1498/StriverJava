When a function calls itself but
UNTIL A SPECIFIED CONDITION IS MET

the condition which is used to stop the recursion calls
is known as Base Condition


int count
main() {
    recursionFunction()
}

void recursionFunction() {
    if(count == 3) {
        return; // This is Base Condition
    }
    print(count);
    count++;
    recursionFunction()
}

we always need an exit condition when using recursion
or else it'd be stuck in an Infinite Recursion until
the Stack memoery overflows

Recursion Tree is the graphical representation of recursion calls
